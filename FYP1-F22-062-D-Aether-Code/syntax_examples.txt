There is a small green leaf on a large gray boulder. The boulder sits in a wide river with pebbles on top of it.

The prefixes identify whether an asset is a subject or an object in a sentence.
The suffixes are used for entity resolution as a single object can be both subject and object across different sentences. (e.g. asset2)
An empty line tells that a new subject/object set is starting here. Now to get actor1/subject location, move down to the line with prefix 'sbj', and fetch the alphanumeric assetID from the line. Use it to get location of actor1. Move up in the file till you reach '\n', and spawn all 'obj's above it using teh above set actor1/sbj's location.
