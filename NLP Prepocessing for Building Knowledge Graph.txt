1. Coreference Resolution: The task of finding all expressions referring to the same entity in a text.

2. Named Entity Recognition: Locate and classify named entities from unstructured text into pre-defined categories. (Try making custom AI models - in your domain of data)

3. Solving disambiguation (of same entity being represented as separate nodes e.g. Elon Musk, Mr. Musk, Elon): Entity Linking

4. Named Entity Linking: Recognize all the entities and then map those to a target knowledge base.
5. Co-occurence graphs: collective interconnection of terms based on their paired presence within a specified unit of text.
6. Relationship Extraction: extracting semantic relationships between a pair of entities (semantic categories) from a text

    Two methods to do so:-
    
    1. Rule-based relationship extraction via grammatical dependencies
    - ignore past/present/future tense of verbs, or words of similar semantic value while making semantic categories
    -lemmatize words before categorization
    
    2. NLP modeling
    - training data
